# EXP 3: Different Types of Operators in C++

## ðŸ”° Aim

To understand and implement **different types of operators** in C++ using:
- `if`, `else if`, and `else` conditions

This experiment includes:
1. Determining whether a number is positive, negative, or zero.
2. Determining the grade of a student based on marks.
3. Identifying the quadrant of a point in a 2D coordinate system.

## ðŸ“š Theory

- `if` â€” Executes a block if a condition is true.
- `else if` â€” Tests another condition if the previous one was false.
- `else` â€” Executes a block if all previous conditions are false.

These are fundamental to controlling the logic and flow of a program.

## ðŸ§  Algorithms

### âœ… Program 1: Positive or Negative

1. Start  
2. Input a number from the user  
3. If number > 0 â†’ print "Positive"  
4. Else if number < 0 â†’ print "Negative"  
5. Else â†’ print "Zero"  
6. End  

---

### âœ… Program 2: Grade Based on Marks

1. Start  
2. Input marks (0 to 100)  
3. Use conditionals:
   - `marks >= 90` â†’ Grade A  
   - `marks >= 80` â†’ Grade B  
   - `marks >= 70` â†’ Grade C  
   - `marks >= 60` â†’ Grade D  
   - `marks >= 50` â†’ Grade E  
   - `< 50` â†’ Fail  
4. Display grade  
5. End

### âœ… Program 3: Identify Quadrant

1. Start  
2. Input `x` and `y` coordinates  
3. Use conditionals:
   - `x > 0 && y > 0` â†’ First Quadrant  
   - `x < 0 && y > 0` â†’ Second Quadrant  
   - `x < 0 && y < 0` â†’ Third Quadrant  
   - `x > 0 && y < 0` â†’ Fourth Quadrant  
   - If either `x == 0` or `y == 0`, it's on the axis  
4. Display the result  
5. End

## âœ… Conclusion

This experiment illustrates how **conditional statements** are used in C++ to perform decision-making. Through three real-world-inspired programs, students learn how to evaluate expressions and control the flow of logic based on variable values.
